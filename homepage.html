             <p class="red">Color theory is extremely important as it influences many aspects of culture, art, fashion, interior design and many more. <br>
             But what is color theory and why is it so important? How does it impact our life? </p>

             <p class="red">Color theory is the study of how colors affect emotions and perceptions. It's a much more scientific subject than you think. Color theory focuses on how to create harmony and contrast; as well as learning how to mix colors effectively to achieve the result you want. <br> This is valuable information to people who are involved with graphic design, marketing, art industry, architecture, photography, and fashion design. By understanding color theory, you are able to make much more informed choices about what colors would be suited for the feeling or style you want to give off. This topic is a fascinating thing to understand and can change your perspective of colors entirely.</p>
             <p class="red">To first start off, you've got to learn the science aspect of it.</p>
