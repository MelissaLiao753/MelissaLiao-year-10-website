        <h2 class="h2-blue">Simultaneous Contrast</h2>
        <p class="p-blue">Have you ever noticed that some colors look different when around other colors?
         This is due to a phenomenon known as simultaneous contrast. 
         This effect occurs when adjacent colors influence each other. 
         Simultaneous contrast makes one color appear to be brighter, darker, or even change hue.
        A dark color adjacent to a brighter color makes both the colors appear brighter than they actually are. 
        Understanding ths is key to creating cohesive art, as it gives you an idea of how different colors will look next to each other.</p>
        <h2 class="h2-blue">Color Schemes</h2>
        <p>There are many types of color schemes which are designed to create different moods/impact. There are 7 types of color schemes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-blue">Monochromatic</h3>
        <p>A Monochromatic color scheme uses exclusively one hue and different shades of that hue.</p>
        <h3 class="h3-blue">Complementary</h3>
        <p>A Complementary color scheme uses two colors that are opposite on the color wheel. This is often used to catch peoples attention because of the high contrast.</p>
